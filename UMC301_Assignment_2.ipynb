    "### Submission instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   The assignment is to be submitted in ONE single notebook.\n",
    "2.   Submit the .ipynb file and pdf of the same with all cells open through this Teams Assignment.\n",
    "3. If your IISc email ID is < username > @iisc.ac.in, then name the file < username >_Assgn_2. E.g. jonathan_Assgn_1a for email ID jonathan@iisc.ac.in.\n",
    "4. Before submission, execute the â€™Restart session and run allâ€™ option from the Runtime/Kernel tab. Verify that there are no errors and that you are getting the output you expect.\n",
    "5. Use the dataset : https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7m0pt1dkmwbkr3byv5r2j/face_images.zip?rlkey=r2gqsdvuyvpqqk4a7bjd9kcvv&st=nj7wl35d&dl=1\n",
